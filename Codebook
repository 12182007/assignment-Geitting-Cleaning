The following data frames were created by extracting data from the text files in the provided data set (UCI HAR Dataset):


 The script Readata.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

    First, all the similar data is merged using the rbind() function. By similar, I address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
    Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
    As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, I take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
    On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
    Finally, I generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded to this repository.

Variables

    

The following data frames were created by extracting data from the text files in the provided data set (UCI HAR Dataset):

features - contains all the features that were measured

activityType - contains activities engaged by subject. Columns were renamed as "activityId" and "activityType"

subjectTrain - contains subject id of each subject in training set. Column renamed as "subjectId"

xTrain - contains measurements of features for each subject engaged in each activity in the training set. Columns renamed with column names of "features" dataframe

yTrain - contains activityId. Column renamed as "activityId"

subjectTest - contains subject id of each subject in test set. Column renamed as "subjectId"

xTest - contains measurements of features for each subject engaged in each activity in the test set. Columns renamed with column names of "features" dataframe

yTest - contains activityId. Column renamed as "activityId"

These are the other data frames that were created.

trainingData - contains ytrain, subjectTrain and xTrain data

testData - contains yTest, subjectTest and xTest data

finalData1 - Obtained by merging "trainingData" and "testData" by "activityId"

finalData - Only contains columns providing mean/std.dev of features

finalDatatbl - data frame converted using "tbl_df" in dplyr package

tidyselect - contains all column data in "finalDatatbl" except "activityType"

tidygroup - "tidyselect" is grouped based on "activityId" and "subjectId"

tidysummary - contains mean of all "features" in the

The following are the vectors that were created

cN - column names of "finalData1"

colNames - column names of "finalData"

logicalVector - contains logical values for column names containing the keywords "mean", "std"

colNames - data vector containing modified column names for the "finalData" dataframe

READ.TABLE() was used for data import

CBIND() was used to obtain "trainingData" and "testData", while RBIND() was used to obtain merged "finalData1"

GREPL() was used for pattern match, to identify column names containing phrases "mean", "std"

MERGE() was used to include "activityType" in the data frame "finalData"

GSUB() was used to for pattern match and replacement, to give more descriptive names to feature measurements

DPLYR package was used to SELECT, GROUP, SUMMARIZE "finalData" to produce a tidy data set containing average of measurements in "finalData" of each subject engaged in each of the 6 activities
